# KubeDogCatExample
 
While learning to use Kubernetes i made this project, i thought i would share it as a little example. The project contains three services, a cat that says "meow", a dog that says "woof" and a controller that presents both.

This is an example of how to both make multiple deployments with services, where only one service can be contacted externally.
